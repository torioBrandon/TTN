An advanced version of Tic Tac Toe for android. 

In an interview, I was asked how I would improve the game of tic tac toe to make it more exciting. I came up with this game, and sketched it out on paper. Later I decided to flesh it out into an actual app, after learning Unity on the job. 

So far, the GUI is not very developed, but the core functions are there.
